        <h2>Introduction to Indian Tree Graph</h2>
        <p>The Indian Tree Graph is a specific type of tree graph that represents the administrative hierarchy of India. It is a hierarchical structure, where each node has a value, and zero or more child nodes. The root node of the Indian Tree Graph is "India", which has child nodes representing the states of India.</p>
        
        <h3>Structure of Indian Tree Graph</h3>
        <p>The Indian Tree Graph can be broken down into the following levels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Root Node:</strong> India</li>
            <li><strong>Child Nodes:</strong> States of India (e.g. Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>State Node:</strong> Child nodes representing districts within the state (e.g. Hyderabad, Mumbai, Lucknow, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>District Node:</strong> Child nodes representing mandals (or tehsils) within the district (e.g. Medchal, Vikarabad, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Mandal Node:</strong> Child nodes representing villages within the mandal (e.g. Pocharam, Ghatkesar, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Properties of Indian Tree Graph</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Connected:</strong> The graph is connected, meaning that there is a path between every pair of nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Undirected:</strong> The graph is undirected, meaning that edges do not have a direction.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cycles:</strong> The graph does not contain cycles or loops.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical:</strong> The graph has a clear hierarchical structure, with each node having a specific level of granularity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Real-World Applications of Indian Tree Graph</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Administrative Management:</strong> The graph can be used to manage and visualize the administrative hierarchy of India.</li>
            <li><strong>Geographic Information Systems (GIS):</strong> The graph can be used to represent geographic data and perform spatial analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> The graph can be used to analyze data at different levels of granularity, from national to village level.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Support Systems:</strong> The graph can be used to support decision-making at different levels of government and administration.</li>
        </ul>
